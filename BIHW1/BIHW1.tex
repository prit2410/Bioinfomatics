\section{Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)}

\subsection{Fisher's Exact Test and Results}
For each SNP, I performed Fisher's Exact Test using the contingency table:
\begin{center}
$\begin{bmatrix} Case_C & Case_T \\ Control_C & Control_T \end{bmatrix}$
\end{center}
I used the two-sided alternative hypothesis to determine statistical significance. The results were stored in \texttt{results.csv} with the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SNP}: The SNP identifier.
    \item \textbf{P-value}: The p-value from Fisher's Exact Test.
    \item \textbf{Significant}: Boolean flag for SNPs where p < $5 \times 10^{-8}$.
    \item \textbf{Bonferroni-Significant}: Boolean flag for SNPs where p < $(5 \times 10^{-8} / 1000)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manhattan Plot}
A Manhattan plot was generated with \texttt{-log10(P-value)} plotted against SNP index. The red dashed line represents the $5 \times 10^{-8}$ threshold, and the green dashed line represents the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. The plot was saved as \texttt{manhattan\_plot.png}.

\section{Sequence Alignment}

\subsection{Custom Substitution Matrix}
A substitution matrix was created for the 26 letters of the English alphabet and space:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Match: +2
    \item Semi-match (characters present in "pritdesai"): +1
    \item Mismatch: -1
\end{itemize}
This matrix was stored in \texttt{1002170533\_S.txt}.

\subsection{Local Alignment: Smith-Waterman Algorithm}
The Smith-Waterman algorithm was used for local alignment of "pritdesai" and the pangram "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." The final alignment matrix was stored in \texttt{1002170533\_D.txt}.

\subsection{Global Alignment: Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm}
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm was implemented to compute the global alignment between "pritdesai" and the pangram. The resulting matrix was saved in \texttt{1002170533\_NW.txt}.

\section{Conclusion}
All required statistical tests and alignments were implemented successfully, with results formatted correctly for grading.

\section{Difficulty Adjustment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{How long did this assignment take you to complete?} \\ 
    This assignment took approximately 8 hours to complete.
    \item \textbf{If the assignment took you longer than 10 hours, which parts were overly difficult?} \\ 
    The assignment was completed within 8 hours, but the most challenging part was implementing the Fisher's Exact Test correctly and ensuring the proper formatting of the Manhattan plot.
\end{itemize}
